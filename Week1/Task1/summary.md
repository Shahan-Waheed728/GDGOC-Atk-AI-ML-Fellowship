Summary of AI vs ML vs DL vs ML
Arrficial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that focuses on creating intelligent machines.
Machine Learning (ML) is one way to induce intelligence into machines by using algorithms that learn from past data and make predictions. 
Deep Learning (DL) is another approach that uses neural networks to process data and identify complex patterns. 
In short, DL is a subset of ML, and ML is a subset of AI. 
Data Science involves collecting data, performing statistical analysis, processing data, and building machine learning models to help organizations make meaningful decisions. 
Ultimately, the main goal of all these fields is Artificial Intelligence.
